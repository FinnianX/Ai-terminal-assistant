This tool will take user input and interpret it to and execute it as a bash command.
It will preview the code for you and you have to approve it before it runs.

WARNING: do not blindly run the commands it outputs. ALWAYS check to see that they wont nuke your computer. Even seemingly inoccent bash can delete files in a heartbeat.

Here is some sample output:

<code>What should i do for you, master: make a file called hello.txt and write Hello Github! to it

 "command": "echo 'Hello GitHub!' > hello.txt"
 
echo 'Hello GitHub!' > hello.txt: execute y/n: y</code>
